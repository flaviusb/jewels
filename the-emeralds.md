# The Defeats

- Defeat a circle with a line

Gentle palm push strike to the knee or inner thigh easily stops many kinds of roundhouse kicks, to the upper arm easily stops many kinds of roundhouse strikes.

- Defeat a line with a circle

'Circular' redirection works well against many kinds of thrusts, and is the basis for many kinds of parries. Note that the circle is figurative: it is not necessarily in line with the strike, and it may be more properly characterised as a spiral, oval or simply a curved arc segment.
