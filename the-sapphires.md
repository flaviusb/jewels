Parts of a fight
================

# Krieg
The idea of 'Krieg' is adapted from the German school of medieval swordsmanship. It refers to the fighting that can only occur inside the inner Fence. Within Krieg there is no need to close, and there is no time for conscious thought. Krieg feels like how you might imagine speed chess, but it is actually more like speed trumps.

The arts that teach Krieg are modified Qin Na and Rondel Dagger.

# Closing
'Closing' is moving from outside of the threat range to inside the threat range, getting past the outer fence any capable opponent should be able to erect.

The arts that teach Closing are reciprocial closing striking drills.

# Opening
'Opening' is creating a gap in an opponents guard which can be exploited. Very simple, obvious examples of openings from Western Swordplay are called Beats, which are blows designed to move the opponent's sword out of line so that defence as such becomes impossible. Opening is what allows striking across the inner Fence.

# Fence
There are two Fences; the outermost Fence is the edge of your reach; an opponent has to cross this no matter what. The inner Fence is what seperates Opening from Krieg; Opening is striking from outside the inner Fence, wheras Krieg is fighting from inside the inner Fence. The Fence is both a guard and a threat, as it has both a physical and a psychological aspect; attempting to cross a capable fence should feel like you are threading your way through a wall of knives which keep their points to you.

The art that teaches Fence is Clinging Death Hands.

# Distance

# Angle

The arts that teach Angle are One Step and Three Step.

# Timing
Timing is two distinct looking things: one is being able to speed up or slow down so that an opponent will 'parry themselves', while the other is being able to wait in stillness until the moment that an opponent moves out of position, loses focus, or otherwise becomes vulnerable. The first is a matter of seeing a fight in four dimensions, while the second is a matter of focus and stillness, though ultimately they seem to spring from the same root.

# Crispness
Crispness is the precision and exactness with which your actions match up to forms; in a large sense, Crispness is strongly related to your ability to use Ki.

The arts that teach Crispness are Long Patterns and Singular Patterns.

# Uncrispiness
Uncrispness is deviation from form in small, precise ways in order to jam up an opponent or prevent their Ki from being able to interlock with your own or indeed with their own.

# Rhythm

# Komi
'Komi' is the ability to get into your opponents head and predict their actions, or to condition them so that they will take a certain action when you trigger them.

The arts that teach Komi are Triangular Pyramid Pushing Hands, No-Contact Throws, and 'Why are you hitting yourself?'.

# Tactility

# Balance
Balance gives you fine control over your motion and the application of power. It is what lets you pivot, turn, or rapidly reverse direction. It encompasses both rootedness and springiness, both being straight and being bent. It is what provides you with an axis, and what lets you chose between several axes rather than being stuck with an implicit one that the forms you have learnt happen to be built around.

The arts that teach Balance are the moving stance drills, tkd bouncing footwork drills with kicks, and exagerrated Amethyst drills of patterns of Amethysts that deliver power in different ways.

# Speed
Speed is basically just a matter of myelin, fast twitch muscle, reacting to things before they happen, and removing the separation between will and action. As such, there are four kinds of things you need to do to develop speed. 'Myelin' is developed through spaced repetition of sets and reaches, and short feedback loops with tightened parameters. Fast twitch muscle is developed through sprinting and speed play. Reacting to things before they happen is developed through switching up random situation drills. Removing the separation between will and action is (this bit is hard to explain - mindfulness exercises with painful interruptions?).

# Power
Power is not just plain strength; many of the techniques to build strength in the modern day do not build power. Deep power takes a very long time to gain, but is with you even as an old person or someone who is injured or unfit. It is in a large sense neuromuscular rather than just muscular, and is also to do with not building up muscles that act against each other, and learning how to let your muscles work with the least wasted strength.

The arts that teach basic Power are Deep Stance Exaggerated Repetitive Drills, Performing Rubies and to a lesser extent Amethysts with and then without different forms of isometrics, performing fast drills to the point of exhaustion and then doing Foot-Calf jumping, duck-walking, burpees, and then doing the drills again, and Sinking-Striking drills.

Power has several properties: where/how it is generated; where/how it is expressed; whether it leads, lags, is synchronised with, or is independent of the movement; and what characteristic temporal intensity pattern it has.

**Major types of power:**
- Cutting
- Chopping
- Piercing/Drilling
- Isolated/floating
    Generated in a single large muscle group close to where it is expressed - ie generated in forearms and expressed through hands or fists.
- Balanced/Clockwork
    Dynamic tension, pivoting along an axis. Generated in the 'roots' and the 'axis', expressed through the axis.
- Sinking
    Uses the lowering of the center of gravity in synch with breath and movement; power is generated in the hara and expressed anywhere.
- Heavy (Deadweight)
    Uses the pure deadweight of ...
- Explosive
    No axis. Entire body, complex movement, split second timing of all muscles.

**Esoteric types of power:**
- Heavy (Like a log submerged in cold water)
- Steady/Unmoving
- Shuddering
- Quivering


# Dexterity

Dexterity can be through of at its simplest as 'point control', the ability to place a part of your body or direct force with precision and intention.

# Fluidity

# Killing Intent
'Killing Intent' is more than simply the willingness to kill; having killing intent, one will grasp at any opportunity to kill your enemy without hesitation it is true, but it is much more even then that. Killing intent means having no filters or boundaries in your mind that make thoughts unthinkable, and not flinching from painful thoughts. You have to be able to accept the possibility of your own death without flinching, and be able to see every way that you could effectively act within the conflict in order to realistically estimate the best course of action in a situation that may turn deadly. This may not involve killing; if one is possessed of Killing Intent one will swallow pride and allow a painful humiliating defeat in order to avoid escalation or harm to a loved one or bystander if that is the best outcome you can calculate.

As I am more merciful than my teachers, I will give no details of the ancient methods for learning Killing Intent, and my art does not use them.

The art that teaches Killing Intent involves visualisation exercises, guided discussions, and the application of enough psychic pressure by the teacher to very carefully fracture the student's mind repeatedly, though I shall write no more about it.
