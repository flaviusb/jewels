Palm push keeping hands within the small door (to block some kinds of kicks or strikes while creating an opening, or with a closed fist as a "punch" to perform a break if the opponent has not kept themselves bent).

Soft hand grab and pull (to break energy or an arm).

#Guarding

Guarding is not 'blocking'. It is a ruby, so it is pervasive.
There are four broad aspects to look at in guarding - deflecting, interdicting, jamming up, and choosing how to take the blow.
This can be seen in the position and micro movements in strikes and stances, as well as considered in the design of static guards.

#Breathing

#Shouting

#Ki

By 'Ki', here I mean energy that is 'form-like'. 'Breaking' Ki shatters apart as the form stops existing; for example, one of the techniques of uprooting someone is to break their root.

'Bent' arms.

'Bent' legs.

Immovable body.

Arms like logs submerged in icy water.

Roots.

#Chi

By 'Chi' here I mean energy that is raised, moved around, purified, manipulated as a thing itself, projected, seized, absorbed, and dispersed. 'Breaking' Chi is simply a shorthand for talking about blocking or diverting the flow; it is not strictly a manipulation of Chi, but rather a manipulation of the channels the Chi flows through.
