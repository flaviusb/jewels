Iron Prism
----------

Iron Prism is my personal Iron Wire form. Iron Wire is a term (like Pushing Hands) that originally properly referred to a specific practice within a singular martial art, but has become a term for a wider practice across martial arts. It originated in Hung Gar (or Hung Kuen) as a basic fitness, qigong, breath control and 'shape' form which can be done in a confined space. Different lineages and even different masters had different Iron Wire forms. Iron Prism is mine.

It is seperated into two parts that need to be combined before it can be performed; the shapes and the styles.

The 'shapes' are a particular set of ur-moves in a particular order; there is only one set of 'shapes'.

The 'styles' are a set of interpretations for the ur-moves; there are several 'styles'.

Combine a set of 'shapes' with a 'style' and you have a concrete series of movements.

## The Shapes

* Opening salute.
* Arms raise spread.
* Arms push spread.
* Arms raise together.
* Arms push together.
* Arms extended together push again.
* Push singly.
* Arms extended press lower.
* Extended strike palm up.
* Extended strike palm down.
* Arms come together in an x low.
* Arms come together in an x high.
* Arms raise crossed fists up.
* Hands press together. _(Palms together, or grasping a dragon orb linearly, or Eagle Claws crossed with wrists touching, or palms flat but slightly apart)._

## The 'Styles'

**Shaolin** - external, hard, simple, linear, isometric but relaxed. Presses with palms and the top and bottom of arms, click clack.

**Strong** - external, hard, linear but extensional, isometric and tense. Presses with fists and edges of arms. No click clack; more like straight punches.

**Circle** - internal, ...

**Dragon** - 

**White Crane** - . Raised palms, tiny circles, strikes with forearms, edges of wrists; various crane strikes.

**Eagle** - external, grabbing and manipulation. No presses, all rotations and manipulations. Lots of Eagle Claw.
